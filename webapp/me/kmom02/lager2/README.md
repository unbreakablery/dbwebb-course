# Stock App For Webapp

In course step 1, we created the basis for our stock app. In this part of the course, we will improve the structure of both our JavaScript code and CSS code. We will build a pick list view where the warehouse workers get a good overview of where the products from an order are. When the goods are picked, the status of the order must be changed and the stock balance must be reduced.

```
    npm install
    npm run style (or npm run style-min)
    npm build
    npm start
```
